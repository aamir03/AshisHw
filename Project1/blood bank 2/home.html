                <p>Blood is a significant component of our body which constitutes almost 7% of the body weight. Blood donation is a noble act where a healthy person donates blood for the use of ailing people.

                    There are four main types of blood groups, namely A, B, O, and AB. The O blood group people are called the universal donor, and AB blood group people are named universal recipients.
                    
                    Blood donation camps are held all over the world to spread awareness about the importance of blood donation so that more people can contribute towards the process of saving lives.</p>
